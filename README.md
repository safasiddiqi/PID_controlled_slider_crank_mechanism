# PID_controlled_slider_crank-_mechanism

The project represents a slider crank mechanism that uses a servo motor to control its movement while there is an ultrasonic distance sensor at the the front of the mechanism which uses a PID system to control the movement of the mechanism. There is a set point desigated in the system so that the mechanism adjusts itself to that distance from the object in front of the sensor. This system is also a practical example of a linear follower that has to keep a certain distance from other objects while following it.
